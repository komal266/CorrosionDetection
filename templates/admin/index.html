        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            Visual inspection is a vital component of asset management that stands to benefit from automation. Using artificial intelligence to assist inspections can increase safety, reduce access costs, provide objective classification, and integrate with digital asset management systems. The automated detection of corrosion from images presents significant advantages in terms of corrosion inspections. The advantages include access to remote locations (wind turbine corrosion detection, underground pipeline corrosion detection, subsea pipeline corrosion detention, etc.), mitigation of risk of inspectors, cost savings, and detecting speed. The work presented here used deep learning convolutional neural networks to build automated corrosion detection models. To approach human-level accuracy, the training of a deep learning model requires a massive dataset and intensive image labeling. A large dataset of 1819 images of CORROSION and NO CORROSION were labeled by a subject matter expert (myself as a corrosion engineer). The results and findings illustrate researchers setting out to develop deep learning models for detecting and locating specialist features.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Corrosion is defined as the deterioration of a material, usually a metal, because of reaction with its surrounding environment (Chilingarian, 1989; Popoola, Grema, Latinwo, Gutti, Balogun, 2013). The reaction can be known as the electrochemical process, which contains various solid and liquid substances. Corrosion can lead to the loss of the purity of the metal. When a metal structure undergoes corrosion, it loses its strength, and the tendency to experience structural collapse increases. For example, ships, tankers, pipelines, wind turbines, and concrete rebars are often subject to the dangerous effects of corrosion. A study by NACE [1] estimates the global annual cost of corrosion at US$2.5 trillion, which is about 3.4% of the worldwide GDP ï¼ˆ2013). These numbers solely represent the direct costs such as forced shut-downs or accidents; neither individual safety nor environmental consequences are included. Therefore, effective corrosion control methods become highly critical in preventing the damaging effects of corrosion. Various methods are widely used in the industry to control and prevent corrosion. These methods include cathodic and anodic protection, corrosion inhibitors, material selection, application of internal and external protective coatings, corrosion monitoring, and inspections (Meresht, Farahani, & Neshati, 2011; Popoola et al., 2013; Samimi & Zarinabadi,2011). Early detection of structural degradation prior to failure does not only have financial benefits. Still, it can also prevent catastrophic collapses of structures and avoid harmful situations for both humans and the environment.

            The recent improvements in Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) for object recognition are largely attributed to the emergence of deep learning artificial neural networks. As one of the major fields of A.I., deep learning mimics the working of the human brain in processing data for use in detecting objects, recognizing speech, and creating patterns for use in decision making. Deep learning has developed as the natural progression from 'shallow networks' to multi-layered networks of neurons that are able to transform representations (of data, including images) from simple to complex, with increasing layer depth [2]. For corrosion protection, the first step towards the maintenance of structures is the visual inspection. Nowadays, this is mainly done by humans to collect qualitative data. Despite that these inspectors are certificated and experienced, the performance of this time-consuming method is subjective and largely dependent on the experience and qualifications of the individual (Agdas et al., 2016).

            On top of that, some locations of structures are difficult or completely inaccessible because of safety reasons, such as deep-sea pipelines, oil tanks, wind turbines, and some hindering constructions. In this paper, supervised learning image classification towards the detection of corrosion is investigated. The purpose of this research is to support the inspectors during the visual corrosion inspection to quickly detect corrosion through images taken by the drone reaching the inaccessible locations without bringing the inspector's safety in danger. In addition, this research also aims to develop a human-level accuracy model for automated corrosion detection, thus increasing the visual inspection efficiency.
